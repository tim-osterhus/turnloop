## 2026-03-05 — Hardening: Gate Research Loop on Spec Validation
Goal: Block Manager runs when staging specs fail validation and invoke the mechanic.
Prompt: agents/work/prompts/001-gate-research-loop-spec-validation.md
Scope:
In: Update `agents/scripts/research_loop.sh` to validate the oldest staging spec before running Manager, set status to `### BLOCKED` on failure, skip Manager, and call `handle_mechanic "manage"`.
Out: Changes to Manager entrypoint or execution loop.
Files to touch:
- agents/scripts/research_loop.sh
Steps:
1. Add a validation step that runs `agents/scripts/validate_spec.sh` against the oldest staging spec before the Manager entrypoint.
2. On validation failure, set research status to `### BLOCKED`, log the failure, and call `handle_mechanic "manage"` without invoking Manager.
3. On validation success, proceed with the current Manager invocation flow.
Acceptance:
- The research loop script clearly shows validation happening before the `_manage.md` entrypoint.
- Validation failure path sets `### BLOCKED` and skips Manager.
Verification commands:
- `rg -n "validate_spec.sh" agents/scripts/research_loop.sh` — Expected: validation call present before Manager invocation.
- `rg -n "_manage.md" agents/scripts/research_loop.sh` — Expected: Manager invocation remains after validation block.
